<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

GTA VI is a 2d multiplayer game that is inspired by the famous game GTA V. The game is built using C++ and Qt for the client side and Node.js and Socket.io for the server side, and MongoDB for the database. The game is built to be played by a maximum of 4 players. Each player tries to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding the obstacles and the other players. Each player also has the ability to shoot bullets at the other players to slow them down and kill them. The game ends when the time is up or when all the players are dead. The player with the highest score wins.
